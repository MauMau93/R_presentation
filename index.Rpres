In 2002, Heather Tollerud, a Saint Olaf College student, undertook a study of the archery scores of
students at the college who were enrolled in an archery course. Students taking the course record a
score for each day they attend class from the first until the last day. Hopefully the instruction they
receive helps them to improve their game.

The plot that was showed before is of crucial importance to the understanding of the effect that attandance had in the average score of the participants. So if something was unclear, we can review it:
